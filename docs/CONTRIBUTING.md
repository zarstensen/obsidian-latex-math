# Contributing To The LaTeX Math Plugin

Planning to make a contribution to this plugin? If so, please make sure to checkout and make PR's to the **dev** branch.

The only exception to this are hotfixes, which should be checked out from and merged into **main**.

## Development Environment Setup

The following sections describe how to set up a development environment for **LaTeX Math**.

Make sure to have [python 3.12 or later](https://www.python.org/) and [node + npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed before continuing.

### Python Environment

Start of with running the `setup-dev-env` python script from the root directory.

This will set up a virtual environment with all the required prod and dev dependencies.

```sh
python setup-dev-env.py
```

To use this development environment in Obsidian, go to the **LaTeX Math** settings in the vault this repo has been cloned to, and toggle the `Developer Mode` switch to on. Make sure to reload the vault after doing this.

The plugin should now use the python source files and the created virtual environment, instead of the auto installed `lmat-cas-client` binary.

Any changes to the python source code requires reloading Obsidian to have any effect.

### Node Environment

Start out by downloading the [`bundle-bin.zip`](https://github.com/zarstensen/obsidian-latex-math/releases) file from the latest release (including beta releases), and extract it in the root directory.[^bundle-bin]

[^bundle-bin]: The exact contents of this folder do not matter as long as `Developer Mode` is on, but esbuild needs them to be present, otherwise dev builds will error out.

Now run `npm ci` still in the root directory.

```sh
npm ci
```

This installs all needed dependencies for developing the Obsidian plugin.
This also sets up pre-push hooks which run all test-suites.
To push to origin without executing the pre-push hook, please use `git push --no-verify`.

> [!CAUTION]
> The pre-push hook does not work if `git push` has been executed whilst in a python virtual environment.
>
> Please make sure to execute `git push` outside any python virtual environment, or use `git push --no-verify` instead.

> [!CAUTION]
> If you are using VS Code as an IDE, make sure to add `push` as an entry to `git.commandsToLog` in VS Code (user or workspace), if you want to see the output of the push hook if it fails.

To start auto building the project on any source code change, run `npm run dev`.

```sh
npm run dev
```

To perform a one-time production ready build, run `npm run build`.

```sh
npm run build
```

## Tests and Code Quality

### Tests

This project uses 2 testing frameworks, [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) for the CAS client and [vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for the plugin codebase.

As such, to run the entire test suite, one needs to execute the below 2 commands whilst inside the python environment.

```sh
pytest
npm run test
```

### Code Quality

This project uses [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for performing some basic code quality checks.

Currently, only checks for redundant whitespace are included.

Use `ruff check` for a status report on code quality issues.

Use `ruff check --fix --preview` for automatically fixing code quality issues.

## Developing

The following sections will provide a brief overview of parts of the codebase for common feature additions / changes.

In general, make sure to look around at similar and relevant code when planning how to implement your feature.

This will give a good understanding of how the code currently works, as well as how your code is expected to be implemented.

Make sure to add tests for any new features, if they are testable by 1 of the 2 test frameworks.

### Adding Commands

First, implement the command under `lmat-cas-client/lmat_cas_client/command_handlers`. This should handle the core CAS logic i.e. the math goes on here.
This file should also provide an interface of the command message (the input) as well as the command result (the output).

Register the command in `lmat-cas-client/lmat-cas-client.py` by calling ``client.register_handler`.

Add relevant message, payload and response interfaces in `src/cas/messages`, these should correspond 1:1 with the message and result interface added in `lmat-cas-client`.

Add a new plugin command under `src/cas/commands`. This handles user interaction with the command as well as insertion of the result.

Register the command in `src/LatexMathPlugin.ts` as an argument to `this.addCommands` call in the `Ã²nLoad` method.

### Extending The LaTeX Parser

The LaTeX parser is implemented with the [lark](https://lark-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/philosophy.html) library.

Start by looking at the [SYNTAX](SYNTAX.md) document, to get a broad overview of the LaTeX syntax,

then dive deeper into `lmat-cas-client/lmat_cas_client/compiling/parsing/latex_math_grammar.lark` and the [lark documentation](https://lark-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_to_use.html), to get a good understanding of the parser.

Transformers can be added or modified at `lmat-cas-client/lmat_cas_client/compiling/transforming`.

### Modifying The UX / UI

The plugin source (`src` folder) primarily handles UI / UX.

`lmat-cas-client` **ONLY** has to do with the core CAS logic, so no UI / UX goes on here.
Same with `src/cas`.
