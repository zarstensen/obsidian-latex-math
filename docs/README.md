# LaTeX Math Docs

## [Commands](COMMANDS.md)

**LaTeX Math** provides its main functionality through a series of Obsidian commands.

This section of the documentation goes through each command in detail.

## [LaTeX Syntax (how to write LaTeX the plugin understands)](SYNTAX.md)

The parser is designed to parse most naturally written LaTeX.

Still, LaTeX is very flexible, and the same visual output can be produced in many different ways.

This section outlines how the parser expects the input to be written.
